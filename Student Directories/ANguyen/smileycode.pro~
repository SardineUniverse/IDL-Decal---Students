  R = MAKE_ARRAY(dimension=100, /INTEGER, VALUE = 100);let's start off with just making the face before eyes and mouth. I set the radius to be 100 
  theta = findgen(100);I guess ranging theta from 0 to 99 in integer steps is enough points
  pplot = POLARPLOT(r, theta, 'b*', TITLE='My Polar Plot');this plots the head
  ;happiness IS OVER

pro smiley
   points = (2 * !PI / 99.0) * FINDGEN(100);this creates the array containing all the angles i want it to draw a point at
   xcenter=0;center of the head is at origin
   ycenter=0;""
   radius=100;the head will have radius of 100
   x = xcenter + radius * COS(points );formula of a circle 
   y = ycenter + radius * SIN(points );formula of a circle
   plot, x, y;make the head
   xcenterrighteye=50;center the right eye at (50,50)
   ycenterrighteye=50;center the right eye at (50, 50)
   radiuseye=25;make the eyes a quarter size of the head
   xrighteye = xcenterrighteye + radiuseye * COS(points );create the x points for the right eye
   yrighteye = ycenterrighteye + radiuseye * SIN(points );create the y points for the right eye
   OPLOT, xrighteye, yrighteye;overlay the right eye on hte head plot
   xcenterlefteye=-50;center left eye at (50,-50)
   ycenterlefteye=50;""
   xlefteye = xcenterlefteye + radiuseye * COS(points );create x points for left eye
   ylefteye = ycenterlefteye + radiuseye * SIN(points );create y points for left eye
   oplot, xlefteye, yrighteye;overlay right eye
end
