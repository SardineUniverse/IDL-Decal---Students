This morning, I ate a slice of whole wheat toast with almond butter, chia seeds, flax seeds, and some blueberries. And I drank coffee, of course.

\subsection{Things I Enjoyed About This Class}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Meeting and interacting with other Astro and Physics majors.
    \item Being able to do anything but Charman homework for two hours a week.
    \item Getting access to the lab. Everyone knows that the number of rooms and buildings that you have keycard access to directly signifies your success.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Things I Did Not Like About This Class}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item I still feel like I don't know much IDL..... which is more my fault than yours, and obviously kind of expected since this is just a decal and not designed to make us all proficient programmers.
    \item Github.
    \item Github.
    \item Github.
    \item Github.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Euler-Lagrange Equation}
$$\sum_{j=1}^{n} (-1)^j\partial^j_{\mu_{1}...\mu_{j}}\bigg(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial f_{i,\mu_{1}...\mu{j}}}\bigg) $$
where summation over the \(\mu_{1}...\mu_{j}\) is implied according to Einstein notation.
